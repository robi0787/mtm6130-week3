    MOBILE FIRST 

    When talking about layouts 
        We are talking about how we use that space on a page.
            desktop vs Mobile
    
    Mobile First means we style for mobile first.
        Style for mobile first 
        Proritize the content as mobile has less space 
        Optimizing bandwidth. Mobile devices may use data and do not need a 3000px image etc. 
        Optimizing for mobile less space, optimize the bandwidth and 
    
    Mobile design is always going to be in single column layout because of less space on screen. 
        We wont see two columns 
        We dont have to do anything special to create a default layout. or the mobile layout

    Viewport Meta Tag
        The very first thing we need to do for creating different sized displays
            Add a meta tag inside the head of the document.
            Give it 2 attributes. 
                Name is the value of the information
                Content what we want to tell the viewport. initial scale is one
            What we are saying in this is
                When this webpage loads on any device,
                    the initial scale is 1 or the 100% width of the body is 100% of any device.
            Use the meta tag to tell the browser that your page is responsive.   
            
    CSS MEDIA QUERIES
    This is the second thing you will need when creating a responsive web design.
        Set of rules that allows our browser to change the styles of our page based on different tags.
        
        You can focus on different styles within a media query
            Screen width
            pixel density 
            or change the style for printing to remove items that you may not want to print.

        There are always needed items that would be added to media query for it to work properly. 

        1) @media starts the media query - tells the browser we are writing a media query
        2) We want to define what media we are focusing on. @media that is a screen.
        3) AND: we want MEdia to be a screen and inside the brackets we are defining the size of the screen.
        4) Min-width we want the screen to be
            These styles that we are creating will not take effect until the screen size of out web browser hits 650px
        5) We add the curly brackets at the end of the brackets. 
            Anything inside the curly brackets will only be applied to the min-width of 650px or above. 
            These are not set widths, you can use any size you like. Based on your design.

            Inside the curly brackets, we are using the same CSS rulesets that we have already learned. 
            Everything will be the same that we have already been using but we are changing the styles for a different screen size. 
                This may be larger font size due to being a larger screen or adding columns etc. 

        Min-width:
            It is best to use min-width when designing. 
            Reason:
                Always going from small screen size to large screen size. 
                Max-width will stop working once you hit that specific point and default to original layout.
                    After hitting that, the styles go back to original as if you didnt style it. 
                IT is easier to use min width bc the styles will continue. 
                <STAY AWAY FROM MAX WIDTH>
